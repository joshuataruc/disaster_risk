    <h3 class="">Before Flood</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="">
        Prepare an evacuation plan. Develop an evacuation plan among all members
        of a household that includes a meeting place outside of the house, as
        well as an escape route out of the floodplain and away from floodwaters.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Safeguard your possessions. Create a personal flood file containing
        information about all of your possessions and keep it in a safe place,
        such as a safe deposit box or waterproof container. This file should
        contain a copy of your insurance policies, a household inventory, and
        copies of all other critical documents.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Prepare your home. There are some simple steps you can take to reduce
        the impact of floodwater on your home and belongings.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Build an emergency supply kit. Prepare an emergency supply kit which
        should include food, bottled water, first aid supplies, medicines, and a
        battery-operated radio.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3 class="">During a flood</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="">
        Listen to your radio or TV for emergency information. Evacuate
        immediately if told to do so.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Do not walk through flowing water. Drowning is the number one cause of
        flood deaths, mostly during flash floods. Currents can be deceptive; six
        inches of moving water can knock you off your feet. If you walk in
        standing water, use a pole or stick to ensure that the ground is still
        there.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Do not drive through a flooded area. More people drown in their cars
        than anywhere else. Do not drive around road barriers; the road or
        bridge may be washed out.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        File your flood claim. To file a claim, you will need your insurance
        company's name, your policy number, and a number where you can be
        reached. Take photos of any water in the house and anything damaged in
        your home. Make a detailed list of all damaged or lost items.

    <h3 class="">Be Aware of Fire Hazards in Your Home</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="">
        Limit distractions when cooking. Don’t leave a hot oven or stovetop
        unattended. Keep anything that can catch fire, such as dish towels or
        wooden spoons, away from your stovetop.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Unplug small appliances when not in use. Make sure that you unplug
        appliances like toasters, toaster ovens and slow cookers when you are
        not using them.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Keep candles at least 12 inches away from anything that can burn. Blow
        them out when you leave the room or before you go to sleep.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Teach kids never to play with matches and lighters. Make a habit of
        placing these items up and away, out of reach and sight of young
        children.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Choose the right wood for your fireplace. Burn only dry, seasoned wood
        and avoid burning trash in your fireplace.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3 class="">How to Create and Practice a Fire Escape Plan</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="">
        Create and practice a fire escape plan. Create a home fire escape plan
        with two ways out of every room (ex. a window and a door). Choose a
        place to meet outside that is a safe distance away from your home.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Practice a home fire drill at least twice a year. Practice a home fire
        drill with your family during the day and at night. Practice escaping in
        under two minutes. Sometimes that is all the time you will have to get
        out of the house safely.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Choose one person to be responsible for getting infants and young
        children out of the home. Have a back-up person to help young children
        just in case the primary person is unable to help.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Teach older children how to follow your fire escape plan. Make sure they
        know to “get low and go” if there is smoke when they are leaving the
        home. Teach them to open windows, remove screens and unlock doors if
        necessary.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3 class="">In an Emergency, Leave Home Immediately</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="">
        If there is a fire, leave home immediately. If there is a lot of smoke,
        get low and crawl out of the house as quickly as possible. Call 911
        after you are a safe distance away from your home. Stay in the safe
        location until emergency personnel tell you it is safe to re-enter your
        home.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Watch for flowing water. If you are in your vehicle, stay alert and
        watch for flowing water, which can be a precursor to a landslide.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Listen. If you are walking or hiking, listen for sounds that might
        indicate a landslide, including boulders knocking together or trees
        crackling. You are generally safer away from slopes, so move to higher
        ground if needed.

    <h3 class="">What to do during an earthquake</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="">
        The steps you should take during an earthquake depend on your location.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3 class="">If You Are Inside</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="">
        Stay inside. Do not get in a doorway — this does not provide protection
        from falling or flying objects, and you might not be able to remain
        standing.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Drop, Cover, and Hold On
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Drop</b> down to the ground so the earthquake doesn’t knock you
            down.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cover</b>your head and neck with your arms to protect you from
            falling debris. If possible, crawl under a sturdy desk, table or
            other piece of furniture for additional protection. Stay away from
            glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and other items that could
            fall.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Hold On</b> on to any sturdy item you can until the shaking
            stops.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Keep candles at least 12 inches away from anything that can burn. Blow
        them out when you leave the room or before you go to sleep.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Teach kids never to play with matches and lighters. Make a habit of
        placing these items up and away, out of reach and sight of young
        children.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Choose the right wood for your fireplace. Burn only dry, seasoned wood
        and avoid burning trash in your fireplace.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3 class="">If You Are Outside</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="">
        Move away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3 class="">If You Are in a Vehicle</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="">
        Pull to the side of the road and stay inside until the earthquake is
        over. Do not stop under overpasses or power lines.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3 class="">What to do after an earthquake strikes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="">Continue to monitor media for emergency information.</li>
      <li class="">Follow instructions from public safety officials.</li>
      <li class="">
        If you are trapped, try calling or texting for help. Try tapping on a
        pipe or wall or using a whistle to help rescuers locate you.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Call 9-1-1 to report emergencies including downed power lines and gas
        leaks.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Stay away from downed utility wires. Always assume a downed power line
        is live.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Stay out of damaged buildings and areas until authorities deem them
        safe.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Check your home for damage:
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you believe there is a gas leak, go outdoors immediately, and do
            not turn electrical switches or appliances on or off.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check chimneys for visual damage and have a professional inspect the
            chimney for internal damage before lighting a fire.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your home or property is damaged, take photos or videos to
            document your damage, and contact your insurance company.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="">
        If phone lines are down, use social media or texting to let others know
        you are OK.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Be a good neighbor. Check on family, friends, and neighbors, especially
        the elderly, those who live alone, those with medical conditions, and
        those who may need additional assistance.

  <div class="modal-inside-container">
    <h3 class="">If you are under a volcano warning:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="">Listen for emergency information and alerts.</li>
      <li class="">
        Follow evacuation or shelter orders. If advised to evacuate, then do so
        early.
      </li>
      <li class="">Avoid areas downstream of the eruption.</li>
      <li class="">Protect yourself from falling ash.</li>
      <li class="">Do not drive in heavy ash fall.</li>
      <li class="">
        Cloth masks help prevent the spread of COVID-19, but they will not
        adequately protect you from inhaling ash for longer periods of time like
        a respirator will. Respirators, like an N-95, are not meant to fit
        children. Due to COVID-19, it may be difficult to find respirators, such
        as N-95s.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Reduce your ash exposure by doing the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Limit your time outdoors and use a dust mask or cloth mask as a last
            resort.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid areas downwind and river valleys downstream of the volcano.
          </li>
          <li>Take temporary shelter from volcanic ash where you are.</li>
          <li>Cover ventilation openings and seal doors and windows.</li>
          <li>
            Avoid driving in heavy ash. If you must drive, keep the windows up
            and do not use the air conditioning system.
          </li>
          <li>Do not get on your roof to remove ash.</li>
          <li>
            If you have any breathing problems, avoid contact with ash and stay
            indoors until authorities say it is safe to go outside.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3 class="">Prepare NOW</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="">Know your area’s risk from volcanic eruption.</li>
      <li class="">
        Ask local emergency management for evacuation and shelter plans, and for
        potential means of protection from ash.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Learn about community warning systems by signing up for a free service
        called the Volcano Notification Service (VNS) that sends notifications
        about volcanic activity. Sign up for email updates about coronavirus
        from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Get necessary supplies in advance, including non-perishable foods,
        cleaning supplies, and water for several days, in case you have to
        evacuate immediately, or if services are cut off. Keep in mind each
        person’s specific needs, including medication. Do not forget the needs
        of pets.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3 class="">Survive DURING</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="">
        Listen to alerts. The Volcano Notification Service provides up-to-date
        information about eruptions.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Avoid areas downwind, and river valleys downstream, of the volcano.
        Rubble and ash will be carried by wind and gravity.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Take temporary shelter from volcanic ash where you are if you have
        enough supplies. Cover ventilation openings and seal doors and windows.
        Wear a mask and maintain a distance of at least six feet between
        yourself and those who are not a part of your household to slow the
        spread of COVID-19.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        If outside, protect yourself from falling ash that can irritate skin and
        injure breathing passages, eyes, and open wounds. Use a well-fitting,
        certified face mask such as an N95. The Centers for Disease Control and
        Prevention (CDC) has a list of certified masks and the maker’s
        instructions on how to use the masks. Use a cloth mask to protect
        yourself for shorter periods of time.
      </li>
      <li>Avoid driving in heavy ash fall.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3 class="">Be Safe AFTER</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="">
        Send text messages or use social media to reach out to family and
        friends. Phone systems are often busy after a disaster. Only make
        emergency calls.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Avoid driving in heavy ash. Driving will stir up volcanic ash that can
        clog engines and stall vehicles.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        If you have any breathing problems, avoid contact with ash. Stay indoors
        until authorities say it is safe to go outside.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Do not get on your roof to remove ash unless you have guidance or
        training. If you have to remove ash, then be very careful as ash makes
        surfaces slippery. Be careful not to contribute additional weight to an
        overloaded roof.

    <h3 class="">Landslide Safety Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Adhere to local land-use regulations. If you live in an area that is susceptible to mudslides or landslides, make sure your home adheres to all local building codes.</li>
        <li>Put property protections in place. To keep landslides from hitting your home and property, consider adding nets, retaining walls, and planting sturdy vegetation, especially on slopes or in places where wildfire has destroyed plants and trees. Do not remove vegetation that may help prevent erosion.</li>
        <li>Add sandbags in exposed areas. If you need to divert water from pathways or places where a retaining wall or vegetation has given out.</li>
        <li>Do not build your home in places that may be in the path of a landslide. For example, on or at the base of unstable slopes and or minor drainage hollows, at the base or on top of an old fill slope and or a steep-cut slope, or areas that are susceptible to flooding.</li>
        <li>Do your research. It is smart to understand your property’s landscape (i.e. where a landslide path may be) and any history of landslides/mudslides in area. Check out the FEMA Flood Map Service Center to research flood zones and land slippages close to your home.</li>
        <li>Look for new cracks. Check out door and window jambs, walls, brick/masonry, foundations, retaining walls, and tilt of utility poles or trees, as they may be signs of previous landslide and risk of future landslide as well.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3 class="">How to stay safe during a landslide</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you find yourself in a landslide, you may have only seconds to act. Here’s what to do:</li>
        <li>Go higher. If you are unable to evacuate, move to an upper level of your home and stay alert while you listen to a NOAA weather radio or watch television for weather updates.</li>
        <li>Watch for flowing water. If you are in your vehicle, stay alert and watch for flowing water, which can be a precursor to a landslide.</li>
        <li>Listen. If you are walking or hiking, listen for sounds that might indicate a landslide, including boulders knocking together or trees crackling. You are generally safer away from slopes, so move to higher ground if needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3 class="">What to do after a landslide</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid the slide area. Keep in mind that the landslide might not actually be over, so take extra precaution and follow local governing authority.</li>
        <li>Call for help.  If possible, alert authorities of the landslide; they will direct any necessary search and rescue missions for people who may be trapped. </li>
        <li>Check for damage. When it is safe to return home or go outside, check your property for and report any damage.</li>
        <li>Listen to your water company. Pay attention to boil advisories or communications from your local water utility company, as landslides can cause water contamination, making it unsafe to drink or use.</li>
